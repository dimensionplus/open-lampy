OPEN LAMPY
Open Lampy is one of the open design/hardware artworks that Dimension+ recently fabricated. The original idea is to combine origami folding technique and laser cutting structure. People can easily assemble a lamp with a paper shade, wood structure, and battery without any soldering technique involved. 

You can play with its design and size or change its structure and light bulb. Replacing the light control with a 555 IC chip or Arduino is another option. It’s much more fun if you can make it into a solar powered lamp! We are expecting more creative energy that can easily be shared in the near future.

OPEN Lampy是超維度互動(dimension+)的開放設計與開源硬體實驗計劃中的系列作品之一，我們希望從最簡單的折紙加上切割組裝的燈具開始，然後搭配上完全不需要銲接的燈具與電池，就能組裝完成一座兼具個性與樂趣的自製燈具。

你可以自由改變造型與尺寸，更換不同的燈座與燈泡，也可以加上555的小IC晶片或是接上Arduino來控制燈光，改裝成太陽能充電等綠色能源供電模式。我們期待OPEN Lampy 能激發各種不同的創意，改造與分享。

OPEN Lampy目前使用創用CC的授權形式，採用姓名標示與相同方式分享。
你可以自己製造自己玩，分享我們的檔案給任何人～
